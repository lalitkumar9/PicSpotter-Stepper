# PicSpotter-Stepper
Text Stepper indicator with Fragments

Stepper Indicator - Stepper indicator is mainly used in Viewpager or in swiping fragments.
But many time we have seen stepper indicator with rounded circle and text below the circle or 
just filled and empty circle indicator. And all the stepper indicator are using third party library so 
to avoid this we have developed the library and using this you can create your own customised stepper indicator
without using any library.

PicSpotter-Stepper can be customised with ViewPager and with Fragments.

This is how PicSpotter-Stepper will look.

1. First Fragment.

2. Second Fragment.

Note -  This library is still under development, we are working on the advance part so feel free to share if there is any improvement required. Your feedback is highly appreciated.
